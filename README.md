ESRI-Hackathon
==============

This project showcases Archaeological Monuments throughout Ireland with the use of technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, Bootstrap, ArcGIS, Google Maps API and Wunderground API. 

When the page loads the User can click on any of the links at the top right corner to load maps/info about different counties in ireland. The default county which is loaded is Dublin, Ireland and from here the user can see a map of the desired area with an operational layer showcasing Archaeological Monuments throughout Ireland. The user can click on each Archaeological Monuments to view a popup which shows information about it such as the name and where abouts in the county it is located. Below the map the user can also see information about the current weather in the area. The information shown here is from the Wunderground API which I used to retrieve JSON responses and from here I parsed the responses to show the user a graphical view of the weather at that current time.
